  An asset management company needs an efficient and reliable database system to manage its diverse
 range of financial services and client portfolios. The company handles numerous clients, each with
 multiple investment accounts, and offers various financial products like mutual funds, stocks, bonds.
 
 The database system should facilitate the seamless management of client information, investment
 transactions, and financial reports. The objective is to ensure data integrity, quick access to information,
 and support for complex queries and reporting.
